# Aviator 1Win: A Comprehensive Guide for Indian Players

## What is Aviator?

Aviator is a popular crash game that has become a hit among Indian
players. Developed by Spribe in 2019, it is a betting game where players
place a bet and watch as a plane takes off. The multiplier increases as
the plane flies, and players must withdraw their winnings before the
plane crashes. The game is based on a random number generator, so there
is no way to predict when the plane will crash.
